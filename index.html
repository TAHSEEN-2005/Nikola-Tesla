                    <p>Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла;[2] pronounced [nǐkola têsla];[a] 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American[5][6][7] inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.[8]

                        Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his 
                        ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.
                        
                        Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.[9]
                        
                        After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.[10] Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor.[11] There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.[12]</p>

                    <p>Poor and reclusive, Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943, at the age of 86, 
                        in New York City—where he had lived for nearly 60 years. His legacy, however,
                         has been thriving for more than a century, and will undoubtedly live on for decades to come.

                        Several books and films have highlighted Tesla's life and famous works, including Nikola Tesla, 
                        The Genius Who Lit the World, a film created by the Tesla Memorial Society and the Nikola Tesla 
                        Museum in Belgrade, Serbia; and The Secret of Nikola Tesla, which stars Orson Welles as John Pierpont
                         Morgan (J.P. Morgan). In recent years, a street sign entitled "Nikola Tesla Corner" was installed in
                          honor of the famous inventor, 
                        near the 40th Street-6th Avenue intersection in New York City.</p>

                  <h2>Tribute to TESLA</h2>
                  <p >Over the past several years, several nonprofit organizations,
                       high-profile individuals, municipalities and Tesla enthusiasts have been involved
                        in a different kind of effort to uphold Tesla's legacy: A project to preserve Tesla's 
                        still-standing, 
                      still-abandoned New York laboratory, Wardenclyffe, and turn it into a museum of the famous
                       inventor's work. For more than a decade, New York's Nikola Tesla Science Center has been working
                        to gain momentum and, subsequently, funding for preserving Wardenclyffe. Since then, the lab's 
                        ownership has been passed through several hands, and public interest for the project has slowly but
                         steadily been growing.

                    Interest escalated in February 2009, when the Wardenclyffe site was posted for sale, for nearly $1.6
                     million. For several years, the Tesla Science Center worked diligently to raise funds for the lab's
                      preservation. The TSC was able to purchase the property in 2013 and plans to turn the site into a 
                      science museum.</p>
